School project to create a smart sprinkler system.  

## Smart Home Sprinkler System
Design a sprinkler controller that can be controlled via a web-based interface. The web app should allow users to program the worst case scenario sprinkler setup. More importantly, the controller should be able to retrieve weather data to adjust water amounts on its own. It also needs to send confirmation email and status updates to owner periodically.
