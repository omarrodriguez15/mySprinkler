##A smart sprinkler controller that talks to weather service
Design a sprinkler controller that can display a web-based interface to allow users to programthe worst case scenario sprinkler setup. More importantly, the controller should be able to retrieve weather data to adjust water amounts. I t also needs to send confirmation email and status update to owner.
